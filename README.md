This repository demonstrates a common but easily overlooked error in COBOL programs: numeric overflow.  The `bug.cob` file contains a simple COBOL program that adds 1 to a numeric field.  If the field reaches its maximum value, it overflows, leading to unpredictable results. The `bugSolution.cob` file shows how to mitigate this problem using appropriate error handling and data type selection.
